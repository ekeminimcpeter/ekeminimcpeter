I am Ekemini Peter (McCoy McPeter), a result-driven individual interested in Embedded Systems. I am conversant with the fundamentals of digital signals (images, audio, and videos) processing using Matlab, and PLC programming with Structured Text (ST). Having undergone a certificate course in Python Essentials 1, I am currently learning Python Essentials 2 (from Cisco Networking Academy) and advanced PLC programming with ST using Codesys.  

I look forward to collaborating on projects involving digital signal processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, TinyML, python programming, and PLC programming.
